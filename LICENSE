Business Source License 1.1

Terms

The Licensor hereby grants you the right to copy, modify, create derivative works, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Licensed Work. The Licensor may make an Additional Use Grant, above, permitting limited production use.

Effective on the Change Date, or the fourth anniversary of the first publicly available distribution of a specific version of the Licensed Work under this License, whichever comes first, the Licensor hereby grants you rights under the terms of the Change License, and the rights granted in the paragraph above terminate.

If your use of the Licensed Work does not comply with the requirements currently in effect as described in this License, you must not use the Licensed Work and you must destroy any copies of the Licensed Work that you have made.

The Licensor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

Except as otherwise provided herein, the Licensed Work is provided to you on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Licensed Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright laws or fair use or other applicable copyright exceptions or limitations.

This License does not grant any rights in the patents, trademarks, service marks, or logos of the Licensor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements as described in the Change License).

Definitions

"Change Date" means the date specified in the header above, which is the date the Change License takes effect.

"Change License" means the license You choose to use after the Change Date.

"Licensed Work" means the software or other material licensed under this License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the material (which shall not include Communications that are not clearly marked or otherwise designated in writing by the Licensor as "Not a Contribution").

"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Licensed Work or upon the Licensed Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, modification, derivative work, improvement, compilation, abridgment, condensation, expansion, or any other form in which the Licensed Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Licensed Work is a software program, Derivative Work includes the result of running the Licensed Work (in whole or in part) as incorporated in a larger work of software, but excludes any work that is merely a reference implementation or example, or work that merely uses the Licensed Work by calling it.

"Source Code Form" means the form of a work preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

"Object Code Form" means any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source Code Form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

"Work" means the work of authorship, whether in Source Code Form or Object Code Form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work.

"You" (or "Your") means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with You. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.

"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Licensed Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.

"Communication" means any form of communication, including but not limited to mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Licensed Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the Licensor as "Not a Contribution."
